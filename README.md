<h2>Overview</h2>
<p align="justify">
This repository is a personal learning project aimed at building a solid understanding of regression techniques in machine learning. It serves as a space to learn, experiment, and enhance my machine learning skills through hands-on experience. The project centers around the Paris Housing Price Prediction dataset, sourced from the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e6/">Kaggle Playground Prediction Competition Season 3 Episode 6.</a>
</p>

<a id="objective"></a>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p align="justify">The main objective of this project is to delve into the fundamentals of regression and gradually progress toward more advanced concepts. Rather than focusing on competing for a high leaderboard position, the goal is to:
</p>

- <strong>Learn the Basics:</strong> Develop a strong foundation in regression techniques, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation metrics.
- <strong>Apply Regression Concepts:</strong> Implement regression algorithms, understand their inner workings, and gain insights into their practical applications.

<h2>Dataset</h2> 
<p align="justify">
The dataset used for this project originates from the Kaggle Playground Prediction Competition. It is a synthetic dataset generated by training a deep learning model on the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mssmartypants/paris-housing-price-prediction">Paris Housing Price Prediction</a>. Although synthetic, the dataset closely resembles real-world data without revealing test labels publicly.

<h2>Notebook Walk-through</h2>
<p align="justify">
Though the notebook is well-detailed with a table of contents, it's quite lengthy, and going through it might not just cut it for some people. So I have decided to provide a summary of all the steps in the notebook. In summary, 
</p>

- I started by downloading the datasets directly from kaggle using the `opendataset` library.
- Performed exploratory data analysis using plotly, seaborn and matplotlib in order to uncover insights and relationships in the data.

- <p align="justify">Moving on from eda, I prepared the data for modeling. First by detecting and removing outliers using boxplot and percentile. Then scaling numeric columns. Also, categorical columns were encoded and finally splitting the dataset.</p>
- The dataset was trained and evaluated on five different models using appropriate evaluation metrics.

After tuning the hyperparameter of the XGBoost model, I was able to obtain a better result with a $RMSE = 135002.53$. The result shown above are not surprising though given how the data was generated.
